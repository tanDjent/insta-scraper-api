# insta-scraper-api
This is an API which takes the username in URL and returns a string in response
which contains the URLS of all the images of that user's instagram profile. 
This currently does not work online as it takes more than 30 seconds to generate the response 
so right now it can only be used locally.

To use it just replace the abcd in username, password and waitForSelector function
with a real instagram accounts username and password and you are good to go.
